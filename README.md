I am a Makers Academy fellowship graduate and full stack software engineer committing myself to the exploration of the coding world. With a background interest in medicine accompanied by a greater fascination with programming, I am looking to develop my coding skills even further and devote myself to creating new and improving old!

I excel in collaborative environments, whether it's through attending code-positive events like 'Rails Girls', contributing to gaming communities I enjoy through modding, or challenging myself in game jams by using tech I am unfamiliar with prior to the beginning of a project (such as my local multiplayer [**Python** game](https://github.com/Hannah-Frost/connect-game-jam)). My appreciation for creativity and problem-solving transfers directly into my abilities to adapt, communicate, and deliver.


## Projects

Here are a couple of highlights:

| Project     | Description | Technology | Testing |
|:-----------:|:-------------:| :------------:| :------------:|
| [Jarvis](https://github.com/Hannah-Frost/Jarvis-App) | **Phone App**: Personalised daily report creator. | React-Native, JavaScript, Node, Expo, X-Code, Travis CI, OpenWeather / CityMapper API | Jest, Enzyme, Cypress |
| [Acebook](https://github.com/Hannah-Frost/acebook-Isambard) | **Web App**: Social media app inspired by facebook. | Ruby-on-Rails, Devise, HTML, CSS, Travis CI, Heroku CD, ActiveRecord (PostgreSQL) | RSpec, Capybara, Simplecov |
| [Red Webbing](https://github.com/Hannah-Frost/connect-game-jam) | **Game**: Local multiplayer game, inspired by the game jam prompt 'connect'. | Python, Pygame | N/A |


## Education

#### Makers Academy (April 1st 2019 - June 21st 2019)

Software Developer course with a strong focus on TDD and OOD.
Focus on an agile development approach in group projects (stand-ups, retrospectives, sprints pair programming / mobbing). The experience of this strategy in my teams has been documented in the [Acebook wiki](https://github.com/Hannah-Frost/acebook-Isambard/wiki) and [Jarvis wiki](https://github.com/Hannah-Frost/Jarvis-App/wiki).

**TECH:** Ruby (Rails, Sinatra, Rspec, Capybara, Twilio), Javascript (Node.js, jQuery, Jasmine)


#### William de Ferrers School (2011-2018)

- EPQ (revolving around pain-related disease and its genetic foundations): A*.
- A-Levels: Classics, Biology. 10 GCSE's: 3 A*, 4 A, 3 B.


## Experience

#### Software Engineer - Zero 1 (Nov 2019-May 2020)

Venture builder studio, partnering with corporations such as Barclays and British Gas to develop new companies.

**TECH:** React Native, TypeScript, Next.js, PostgreSQL


#### Software Engineer - Koble (May 2020-Present)

Platform that guides new startups to success through data-driven algorithms.

**TECH:** React, TypeScript, Next.js, Chakra UI, ApolloClient, GraphQL, Jest, Enzyme, Cypress

## Skills

#### Organisation, and Responsibility

- I attended a 'Young Doctors' programme and subsequently work shadowed in a hospital's department of surgery. Upholding patient confidentiality and keeping practical communication in a sensitive and high pressure environment strengthened my sense of responsibility. The ability to conduct myself professionally and retain a strict schedule was integral for participation in these events.

- Recent clinic work involved assisting with COVID-19 vaccinations through pinnacle. This included the management of large quantites of private patient data and locating patients with swift precision, as the efficency at which I work directly correlates to the speed at which patients can be vaccinated. This level of organisation is reflected through my programming work via use of software such as Figma and Jira to prepare, track, and time-manage the flow of a project.

#### Communication, Teamwork, and Adaptation

- National Championships winning team of LionHeart 2015 (a nationwide enterprise programme). I acted as team leader, scribe, designer, researcher, marketer, and presenter (showcasing our ideas to an audience of over 100 people) throughout the experience. As a team, we created a concept of a hiking suit laced with non-newtonian fluid as a shock-absorbing safety precaution. This project broke multiple records and we were the winners in the majority of categories; therefore demonstrating my ability to work effectively in a team in order to overcome challenges as well as displaying my versatility with taking on a variety of roles within a team as needed.

- Throughout my education I was a member of the Peer Support Programme, involving allocating and managing spare time around other students requiring assistance at school - both with emotional and personal challenges, as well as tutoring in subjects (specifically the sciences). This was a thoroughly rewarding programme for me as I felt I could make a positive impact in people's lives and although I spent a lot of time teaching others, I myself learnt that not every challenge can be overcome by advice alone but also through perseverance and exploration (which is a mindset I have since applied to programming).

- Whilst at Makers Academy I was consistently pair programming and participating in group projects with new faces and unfamiliar technology.


## Interests

Outside of programming, I also enjoy:
- Drawing; a perfect downtime to exercise my creative side!
- Crochet.
- Badminton.
- (Mainly) gaming!
